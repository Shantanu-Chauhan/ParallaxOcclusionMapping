Left click mouse movement changes the tilt and spin.(in both scene and eye view)
Right click moves the scene around.(In scene view only)

For this project- 
Created the skydome, added texture to the pot(cracks), the podium(wood), the walls(brick)flipped the texture, created multiple copies and scaled it in the shader. Did the same for the sea(did not flip it). Used the normal/bump maps for all the texture. 

For the procedural checkerboard, used the same method as you used to create the ground before I had put the texture on it. And did the calculation in the shader using fract to get scale the image and have a border around it.

I had met with you regarding the seam on the sea. Would be happy to know that the seam was just a hardware thing, if its something else again would be happy to know the reason.

I am extremely sorry for not submitting it on time.
